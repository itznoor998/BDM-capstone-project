# 🧾 Data-Driven Demand & Inventory Planning for a Rural Grocery Shop  

> *A Business Data Management Capstone Project focused on enabling smarter inventory decisions for small retail businesses through primary data analytics.*

---

## 🏪 Project Overview  

**Mallick Bhandar** — a small, family-run grocery shop located in Khoriop, Howrah (West Bengal, India) — faced operational inefficiencies due to:  
- 🔹 Lack of visibility into **seasonal demand fluctuations** (especially during local festivals)  
- 🔹 Absence of **data-driven inventory planning**, leading to stockouts and overstocking  

This project applies **business analytics and data science** techniques to convert handwritten sales records into actionable insights that drive better **forecasting, stocking, and profitability decisions.**

---

## 🎯 Objectives  

1. **Identify seasonal sales trends** using time-series and descriptive analysis.  
2. **Optimize inventory planning** through ABC classification and demand variation metrics.  
3. **Recommend data-backed decisions** for improving stocking strategy and space utilization.

## 🧩 Dataset Details  

| Feature Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Source** | Primary data collected from Mallick Bhandar’s daily handwritten sales bills |
| **Period** | June 2024 – May 2025 (365 days) |
| **Records** | 365 rows × 19 columns |
| **Products** | 18 essential grocery items (Rice, Wheat Flour, Spices, Oils, Pulses, Snacks, etc.) |
| **Tools Used** | Excel (data entry, cleaning, summary) & Python (advanced analytics, visualization) |

---

## ⚙️ Methodology  

### 1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
- Manual digitization of primary handwritten sales bills.  
- Outlier detection via box plots; median imputation for invalid entries.  
- Formatting & validation for 18 product categories.  

### 2. **Exploratory & Descriptive Analysis**
- Central tendency and variability (mean, median, std. dev., skewness, kurtosis).  
- Festival-wise demand comparisons and trend detection.  
- Visual analysis through time-series, box plots, and bar plots.  

### 3. **Advanced Analytical Techniques**
| Technique | Purpose | Business Insight |
|------------|----------|------------------|
| **Rolling Average Trend Analysis** | Identify festival-season spikes | Better stock planning before peak demand |
| **Demand Variation Index (DVI)** | Measure demand volatility | Plan restock frequency and buffer levels |
| **ABC Classification** | Prioritize products by sales volume | Focus restocking on high-value items |
| **Correlation Analysis** | Find complementary products | Enable product bundling & shelf optimization |

## 📊 Key Insights  

- 📈 **High-demand & stable products:** Rice (Local), Pulses, Potatoes & Onions — require consistent stock.  
- 🎉 **Festival-driven items:** Cooking Oils, Spices, and Snacks show 40–90% demand surge during festivals.  
- 🧮 **Top 8 items (A-category)** contribute **70%** of total annual sales.  
- 🧩 **Correlated pairs** like Snacks–Soft Drinks and Tea–Sugar suggest **cross-selling** potential.

## 💡 Recommendations  

✅ **Create a Festival-Specific Procurement Calendar** – Anticipate demand spikes during Eid, Durga Puja, etc.  
✅ **Implement Rolling Average Forecasting** – Weekly trend tracking for top SKUs.  
✅ **Adopt ABC-Based Inventory Management** – Prioritize essential items; reduce holding cost for low-demand SKUs.  
✅ **Bundle Complementary Products** – Increase sales with product pairing (e.g., Snacks + Soft Drinks).  
✅ **Optimize Shelf Space** – Rotate placement based on seasonal products.
